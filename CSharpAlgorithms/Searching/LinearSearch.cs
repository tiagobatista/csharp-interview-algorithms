/*
Linear Search is the simplest search algorithm.
It checks each element in the list sequentially until it finds the target element or reaches the end of the list.
Although it's not as efficient as Binary Search, Linear Search is straightforward and can be used on both sorted and unsorted arrays.
Itâ€™s most useful for small datasets or when the list is unsorted.
